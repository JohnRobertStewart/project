	Happy funtime Plan for MERN Project "PROJECT" 

[] Figure out what I want the site to do exactly

[] Create User accounts and Admin accounts
   - User accounts mostly done
   - Create Admin accounts (privilages)
[] Admins submit modules of Q and A, Users complete them
   - Admim can submit standardized 'quiz' modules in possibly PDF form
   - Users can complete see and interact with these
[] Users can choose and complete a module, then submit the answers
   - Store completed modules tied to  User accounts, separate from primary module
   - Only Admins can see completed modues from all users
   - Users can see their own completed modules
[] Users see the completed modules - if they are Graded or Awaiting a grade
   - No redoing the same module twice 
   - Can see if a module has been submitted or not 
   - Possibly save data in a module for tinkering but not submitted 
[] Admins grade the module - then submit that grade 
   - Users can see the now graded module
   - No regrading a module for admins
[] Users who complete a module can pay for a 'prize'
   - Just want to implement a payment system of some kind
   - MVP just an option to tip the creator, make sure the payment system works 

	POSSIBLE / DESIRED FEATURES

[] Submitted modules can be accessed and created by an Admin only, through a web portal
   - Instead of using a PDF or other standard format
[] See rankings of other users
[] Figure out the prize system
